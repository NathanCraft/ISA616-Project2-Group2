## Project Overview

Annually, the FSB conducts a senior survey of graduates to learn of their employment status.  In addition, information is verified using LinkedIn and employer survey information.  The data you are provided ('FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds') contains data on graduates for 2019, 2020, and 2021.  The data are merged from two sources:  the senior survey and data from the Miami University database.  

The data are anonymized, however, it is possible that if you look hard enough, you can identify students.  You are bound, ethically, not to do so.  It is a strict ethical code that you will not discuss individual data points with ANYONE except for me and your team.  Failure to comply with this code of ethics will result in a failing grade in the course.  

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is for Nathan Craft and Elle Prusko to answer the question: "What are the macro placement and salary trends we have seen over the past three years?". To do so, we have identified potential pains for our audience. Such pains consist of 
- Lack of information to better guide students down the right career path 
- Finding students high-paying jobs that fit their major
- Deeper understanding of salary trends by industry
- Limited staffing to allocate sufficient time to each studentâ€™s needs

To eliminate these pains, we intend to pilot an FSB Placement Analysis where we will visualize and understand salary and placement trends. We will also do external research on salary trends in related industries and deliver a soundbite of key findings and data-driven recommendations.
